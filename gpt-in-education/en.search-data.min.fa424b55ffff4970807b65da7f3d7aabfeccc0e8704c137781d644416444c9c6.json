GPT in Education The examples demonstrate that GPT can produce text that resembles a human\u0026rsquo;s writing. GPT can also rewrite text based on a user\u0026rsquo;s instructions. Generating text is one of many applications of generative AI. Further capabilities of GPT, which include scoring in the 90th percentile on the Bar exam and passing several AP exams, can be found on OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s website (Citation: OpenAI,\u0026#32;2023OpenAI,\u0026#32; O.(2023,\u0026#32;3/14).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://openai.com/research/gpt-4/ ) .\nThe intersection of GPT and education is interesting for two reasons. First, it opens up new opportunities for students and teachers to learn more effectively. Second, this tool can be used by students to avoid doing work themselves. This website aims to examine the good and bad of GPT.\n  OpenAI (2023)  OpenAI,\u0026#32; O.(2023,\u0026#32;3/14).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://openai.com/research/gpt-4/     "},{"id":1,"href":"/gpt-in-education/docs/responses/","title":"Responses","section":"Docs","content":"Responses University Responses In response to the release of ChatGPT in November 2022 (Citation: OpenAI,\u0026#32;2022OpenAI,\u0026#32; O.(2022,\u0026#32;12/30).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt ) , several universities including Stevens (Citation: Lipizzi\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Morgan,\u0026#32;2023Lipizzi,\u0026#32; C.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Morgan,\u0026#32; G.(2023,\u0026#32;1/19).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://www.stevens.edu/news/is-chatgpt-going-to-eat-or-save-the-world ) , Harvard (Citation: Mucharraz y Cano,\u0026#32;Venuti \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32;2023Mucharraz y Cano,\u0026#32; Y.,\u0026#32; Venuti,\u0026#32; F.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Herreta Martinez,\u0026#32; R.(2023,\u0026#32;2/1).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://hbsp.harvard.edu/inspiring-minds/chatgpt-and-ai-text-generators-should-academia-adapt-or-resist ) and Stanford (Citation: Lee,\u0026#32;Lemons \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32;2022Lee,\u0026#32; V.,\u0026#32; Lemons,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Brown,\u0026#32; B.,\u0026#32; Lising Antonio,\u0026#32; A.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Levine,\u0026#32; S.(2022,\u0026#32;12/20).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://ed.stanford.edu/news/stanford-faculty-weigh-new-ai-chatbot-s-shake-learning-and-teaching ) responded with articles explaining their view on the new technology. The professors who responded have mixed feelings regarding generative AI because it allows students to complete homework assignments. However, some faculty members believe that the benefits of GPT outweigh the downsides. The following is a list of ideas common among the university responses.\nDisclaimer\nThese responses were given within three months of the release of ChatGPT. This means that, at the time of responding to ChatGPT, the universities have little to no classroom experience.\n College Admissions The college admissions offices will now have to sift through essays written by both students and AI. The question is: Will ChatGPT change who gets accepted into competitive universities? If so, is there a group of people that this new technology will disproportionately impact?\nAccording to Stanford (Citation: Lee,\u0026#32;Lemons \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32;2022Lee,\u0026#32; V.,\u0026#32; Lemons,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Brown,\u0026#32; B.,\u0026#32; Lising Antonio,\u0026#32; A.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Levine,\u0026#32; S.(2022,\u0026#32;12/20).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://ed.stanford.edu/news/stanford-faculty-weigh-new-ai-chatbot-s-shake-learning-and-teaching ) , the accessibility of this technology will lead wealthier people to find new ways of standing out from the crowd. Anthony Lising Antonio, associate professor of education, predicts that a \u0026ldquo;for-profit cottage industry\u0026rdquo; will develop to help people design competitive applications that stand out from the AI-generated mass.\n Example (AI GPT generated essay) ↕  As my worn-out sneakers pounded the sidewalk, the rhythmic thud of my heartbeat filled my ears. Running was the metronome of my life, steady, unyielding, and more than anything, constant. The sun dipped beneath the horizon, and a sliver of moon illuminated the sky. The question, however, lingered in my mind as I ran: Can I break free from the confines of my small town and create a meaningful impact on the world?\nMy life began in a rural town so remote that it could have been plucked straight out of a Steinbeck novel. Growing up, I was immersed in a cultural tapestry of cornfields, pick-up trucks, and Friday night football games. While my roots are deep, I found myself yearning for more - a life beyond the finite boundaries of my hometown. My curiosity spurred me to explore, ultimately leading to an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a deep-seated desire to make a difference.\nOne fateful day, I stumbled upon an old, dusty book buried beneath a pile of outdated encyclopedias at our local library. It was a collection of essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson. As I read, I became entranced by his philosophies of self-reliance and the pursuit of truth. Emerson\u0026rsquo;s words resonated within me, igniting a spark that ultimately ignited my passion for literature and a desire to explore the world through the eyes of great thinkers.\nThis newfound passion led me to establish a monthly book club at our local community center. I was determined to bring people together to discuss literature, exchange ideas, and inspire one another to dream big. Our motley crew of literary aficionados consisted of farmers, factory workers, and high school students alike. The first few meetings were awkward, but as the months progressed, I watched with pride as our group coalesced into a community of engaged, thoughtful citizens.\nThe power of literature, I discovered, transcends the borders of geography and age. It creates a common ground upon which we can challenge our beliefs, explore the depths of the human experience, and dare to envision a brighter future. It was in those moments, sharing ideas and laughter in our book club meetings, that I realized the true potential of education: to transform lives and unite people in the pursuit of knowledge.\nAt Harvard, I see an opportunity to delve deeper into this transformative power of learning. I hope to collaborate with my peers, engage with brilliant professors, and work together to solve the complex challenges facing our world. The hallowed halls of Harvard hold the promise of intellectual growth and the chance to develop the tools necessary to make a lasting impact on the world.\nAs I stride forward, my sneakers still beating a familiar rhythm against the pavement, I am filled with a sense of purpose. I am ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. I am prepared to step beyond the confines of my small town and embark on the journey of a lifetime.\nSo here I stand, at the precipice of a new beginning, with the words of Emerson echoing in my mind: \u0026ldquo;Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.\u0026rdquo; At Harvard, I am determined to blaze a trail that leads not only to personal growth but also to a brighter, more connected world for all.\n   Helps Teachers ChatGPT can make teachers more effective. In February 2023, Harvard described the positive and negative impact ChatGPT would have on the classroom. Regarding the positives, they focused on how teachers can use it to create review sessions, automatically grade homework, and emulate conversation for language learning (Citation: Mucharraz y Cano,\u0026#32;Venuti \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32;2023Mucharraz y Cano,\u0026#32; Y.,\u0026#32; Venuti,\u0026#32; F.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Herreta Martinez,\u0026#32; R.(2023,\u0026#32;2/1).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://hbsp.harvard.edu/inspiring-minds/chatgpt-and-ai-text-generators-should-academia-adapt-or-resist ) .\nOverreliance If a student graduates from high school or university using ChatGPT to solve their homework, the question becomes: Did the student graduate, or did ChatGPT graduate? The Harvard Business Publishing states that students can overuse generative AI and \u0026ldquo;miss out on important learning opportunities\u0026rdquo; (Citation: Mucharraz y Cano,\u0026#32;Venuti \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32;2023Mucharraz y Cano,\u0026#32; Y.,\u0026#32; Venuti,\u0026#32; F.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Herreta Martinez,\u0026#32; R.(2023,\u0026#32;2/1).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://hbsp.harvard.edu/inspiring-minds/chatgpt-and-ai-text-generators-should-academia-adapt-or-resist ) .\nIn general, when people depend on unreliable technology, it can lead to problems. For example, I always use Google Maps when I drive, and while the technology is more reliable than my memory, my phone battery is unreliable. When my phone does, I am lost and must stop to charge or drive out of the way until I recognize a road. This example demonstrates that becoming reliant on a technology that is only sometimes available can be problematic. ChatGPT is far from reliable as it requires an internet connection, paid subscription (to have access when servers are overloaded), and often outputs fabricated facts. If tech companies can fix these problems and make language models reliable, the case against overreliance is diminished.\nBe Cautious ChatGPT is a tool, and the output of this tool can mislead students. I asked Professor Schaumann, a computer science professor at Stevens, how ChatGPT will impact education. In contrast with the articles released early this year, Professor Schaumann has had an entire semester of classroom experience with these tools. As a result, his response differed from the standard response of either trying to promote or detect cheating using ChatGPT. Instead, he focused on the danger ChatGPT has to students.\nIf students use ChatGPT to learn the information they do not know, how will they verify that the output of ChatGPT is correct? The problem is that ChatGPT can generate text that looks reasonable, but the facts it points out are often false. The same problem occurs when students trust the first article they read after Google searching a question. Therefore, professor Schaumann recommends that, when using Google or ChatGPT to answer questions, students ask themselves, \u0026ldquo;(a) what you\u0026rsquo;re asking, (b) if what you\u0026rsquo;re asking is actually what you need to know, (c) if what you found does actually answer your question, and (d) what assumptions or shortcuts the answer is making.\u0026rdquo;\nAcademic Responses GPT For Good? Although there are many ways that ChatGPT can be abused to get out of doing work in an educational context, if used correctly, ChatGPT leads to a better educational system (Citation: Kasneci,\u0026#32;Sessler \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32;2023Kasneci,\u0026#32; E.,\u0026#32; Sessler,\u0026#32; K.,\u0026#32; Küchemann,\u0026#32; S.,\u0026#32; Bannert,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Dementieva,\u0026#32; D.,\u0026#32; Fischer,\u0026#32; F.,\u0026#32; Gasser,\u0026#32; U.,\u0026#32; Groh,\u0026#32; G.,\u0026#32; Günnemann,\u0026#32; S.,\u0026#32; Hüllermeier,\u0026#32; E.,\u0026#32; Krusche,\u0026#32; S.,\u0026#32; Kutyniok,\u0026#32; G.,\u0026#32; Michaeli,\u0026#32; T.,\u0026#32; Nerdel,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Pfeffer,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Poquet,\u0026#32; O.,\u0026#32; Sailer,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Schmidt,\u0026#32; A.,\u0026#32; Seidel,\u0026#32; T.,\u0026#32; Stadler,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Weller,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Kuhn,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Kasneci,\u0026#32; G.,\u0026#32; Chiriatti,\u0026#32; F.,\u0026#32; et al.,\u0026#32; D.,\u0026#32; et al.,\u0026#32; T.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;et al.,\u0026#32; V. \u0026#32; (2023). \u0026#32;ChatGPT for good? On opportunities and challenges of large language models for education. ) . In an article submitted in February titled \u0026ldquo;ChatGPT for good? On opportunities and challenges of large language models for education\u0026rdquo;, Kasneci et al. elaborate on the potential benefits of using AI in education. Here are several domains of education that generative AI can assist.\n Elementary School. ChatGPT can be used to analyze student responses to correct grammar and provide feedback on critical thinking skills. Middle \u0026amp; Highschool. Used to generate learning material such as quizzes. Provides example solutions that students can follow. College Students. Summarize text to increase learning rate. It helps students retrieve information. Disabilities. The flexibility of AI leads to more flexible learning strategies. It can help rework topics in ways that students can better understand.  Kasneci et al. also describes how researchers used GPT3 to generate student quizzes. I thought this would be a fun experiment to recreate, so I created a GitHub repository that does that. You can view it here.\nBullshit Spewer One of the more critical reviews of ChatGPT titled \u0026ldquo;ChatGPT: Bullshit spewer or the end of traditional assessments in higher education?\u0026rdquo; guides how to adapt to this new technology (Citation: Rudolph,\u0026#32;Tan \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32;2023Rudolph,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Tan,\u0026#32; S.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Tan,\u0026#32; S. \u0026#32; (2023). \u0026#32;ChatGPT: Bullshit spewer or the end of traditional assessments in higher education?. ) . To set the stage, Jurgen et al. say that the problem arises from technology progressing faster than the educational system. In a slightly joking manner, they state that it will take\u0026hellip;\n \u0026ldquo;10 years for academia to face this new reality: two years for the students to figure out the tech, three more years for the professors to recognize that students are using the tech, and then five years for university administrators to decide what, if anything, to do about it.\u0026rdquo;\n One workaround is to asses students on assignments that AI models are deficient in. This is a short-term solution as the models continue to improve, but hopefully, it will give the school enough buffer to adapt to the new technologies. The limitations of the model are the following:\n  Image understanding. ChatGPT cannot understand images, so assessing students based on video or images is one way to degrade the ability of students to cheat using AI tools.\n  Recent Events. AI models often have a data cutoff in which a model is unaware of any events that occur after that date. Assigning relating to current events is harder for students to solve with AI.\n  Niche Topics. While the breadth of knowledge in a GPT model is impressive, it is not limitless. The more Niche a topic is, the less likely an AI model is to generate a correct response.\n  Personal Experience. By assigning homework specific to a student, teachers can increase the difficulty of cheating.\n  Cross Referencing. ChatGPT needs help creating valid references. By assigning homework that requires students to reference different research papers, they will need more time to leverage AI.\n  Even if an educator uses the tips provided here, students can still find ways to bend the rules. In addition, developments in GPT4 are already showing abilities to understand images and increase contextual awareness. For example, if a student is asked to write an essay about a current event, they can paste a recent news article into GPT4, and it will understand the current event.\nBibliography   Rudolph,\u0026#32; Tan\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Tan (2023)  Rudolph,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Tan,\u0026#32; S.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Tan,\u0026#32; S. \u0026#32; (2023). \u0026#32;ChatGPT: Bullshit spewer or the end of traditional assessments in higher education?.

LLMs can improve education if used correctly, but using them in certain situations can lead to adverse outcomes. In an article written on March 13, 2023, titled \u0026ldquo;Chatting and cheating: Ensuring academic integrity in the era of ChatGPT,\u0026rdquo; Cotton et al. outline several negative aspects of ChatGPT (Citation: Cotton,\u0026#32;2023Cotton,\u0026#32; D. \u0026#32; (2023). \u0026#32;Chatting and cheating: Ensuring academic integrity in the era of ChatGPT. ) .\n The goal of education is the challenge students so that they learn. Using AI to generate answers removes the challenge and leads to less learning. It is unfair to students who work hard to write an essay independently when their peers are using ChatGPT to generate the same material. Assessing how well a student understands the material in the form of an essay is hard to do when an AI-generated text can obtain a passing grade. This leads to a devaluation of degrees (Citation: Cotton,\u0026#32;2023Cotton,\u0026#32; D. \u0026#32; (2023). \u0026#32;Chatting and cheating: Ensuring academic integrity in the era of ChatGPT. ) .  However, a blanket ban on GPT in education could cause more problems than it solves because it is hard to enforce. One problem an unenforceable ban on ChatGPT would cause is that the people who use ChatGPT would attempt to hide its use. This is a problem because it would be unfair to honest students in competitive situations. The other problem with banning ChatGPT is that students must learn to use the tools ethically. Therefore, a school needs access to AI tools to teach students about them.\nDetection OpenAI has released an AI Text Classifier (Citation: OpenAI,\u0026#32;OpenAI,\u0026#32; O. (s.d.).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier ) . However, this technology has several limitations. In addition to this tool emitting both false positives and false negatives, there are several ways to avoid detection, including using ChatGPT (Citation: Goggin\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Tolentino,\u0026#32;2023Goggin,\u0026#32; B.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Tolentino,\u0026#32; D. \u0026#32; (2023). \u0026#32;ChatGPT can help you fool OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s anti-cheating tool.  ) . In general, detecting AI-generated text is related to knowing the limitations and weaknesses of the technologies available. Here are several strategies for detecting AI-generated text.\n Plagiarism Detection. The (Citation: OpenAI,\u0026#32;OpenAI,\u0026#32; O. (s.d.).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier ) provided by OpenAI and (Citation: Tian,\u0026#32;Tian,\u0026#32; E. (s.d.).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://gptzero.me/ ) are two free tools that can be used to detect AI-generated text. Check References. According to the Clare (Citation: Williams,\u0026#32;2023Williams,\u0026#32; C. \u0026#32; (2023). \u0026#32;Hype, or the future of learning and teaching? 3 Limits to AI\u0026rsquo;s ability to write student essays. ) , the references ChatGPT often creates \u0026ldquo;collapses into a haphazard Harvard style.\u0026rdquo; Clare (Citation: Williams,\u0026#32;2023Williams,\u0026#32; C. \u0026#32; (2023). \u0026#32;Hype, or the future of learning and teaching? 3 Limits to AI\u0026rsquo;s ability to write student essays. ) also mentioned a student that fabricated an entire essay combined with a bibliography. However, the references did not check out, and the student later confessed to using AI. The current versions of GPT fail to create sophisticated references to reputable sources, so requiring writing that involves research can help prevent the use of ChatGPT. Check for Hallucinations. An AI hallucination is when the AI is confident about a fact because it \u0026ldquo;seems about right\u0026rdquo; rather than verifying it.  Alternative assignments Halaweh (Citation: Halaweh,\u0026#32;Halaweh,\u0026#32; M. \u0026#32; (n.d.). \u0026#32;ChatGPT in education: Strategies for responsible implementation. ) , Atlas (Citation: Atlas,\u0026#32;2023Atlas,\u0026#32; S.\u0026#32; (2023). \u0026#32;ChatGPT for Higher Education and Professional Development: A Guide to Conversational AI.  ) and Clare (Citation: Williams,\u0026#32;2023Williams,\u0026#32; C. \u0026#32; (2023). \u0026#32;Hype, or the future of learning and teaching? 3 Limits to AI\u0026rsquo;s ability to write student essays. ) all provide advice on how to create assignments that limit the possibility of cheating when GPT is banned.\n Use Current Events. ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 are limited because their data set is cut off at a particular date. This means that it becomes harder for a student to say, \u0026ldquo;Write me an essay about X,\u0026rdquo; where X is an event that happened in the past couple of years {{ cite \u0026ldquo;hype-or-future\u0026rdquo; }}. This is not a foolproof way to prevent students from using GPT in situations it is banned, but it can help. Require Presentations. Presenting research is a good way to ensure students learn the material rather than copy the output of an AI. While students can still use ChatGPT to generate a presentation, they at least have to copy the material into a PowerPoint and memorize the slides.  None of these ways prevent entirely students from abusing AI in situations it is banned, but they can help. It is important to note that these strategies are workarounds that target the current language models\u0026rsquo; weaknesses. However, as these models improve, the strategies for preventing their use should also change.\nReferences   Halaweh (n.d.)

I think it does an excellent job explaining the high-level ideas that would appear in the course outline. However, it often fails to give enjoyable, down-to-earth examples that make the information stick. In addition, it does not pull in outside resources like videos or articles for me to reference.\nHowever, this technology has potential, and if someone designs an application around GPT using it as the interface between the student instead of the entire tutoring software, it could work.\nHere is the transcript of my conversation with GPT regarding Computers and Society:\nInitial Context  [User] Initial Prompt ↕  Act as an AI-powered intelligent tutoring tool, that provides personalized guidance and feedback to learners across various domains. With its advanced algorithms, the tool will adapt to each individual learner\u0026rsquo;s unique learning style and pace, ensuring a tailored and effective learning experience. The tool will allow users to input their learning goals and preferences, and it will generate customized lessons and assignments. The tool will provide immediate feedback and support for each task, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and other advanced technologies to analyze learner responses and offer constructive feedback. To check how well the user has learned the lessons, also known as personalized guidance, it will generate a test based on the guidance received. The tool will generate the test at random intervals between 2 and 5 lessons, and the test will be graded in a 10 point system or in percentage. The tool will also have a dashboard that enables learners and educators to track progress, view achievements, and identify areas of improvement. The dashboard can be accessed using the keyword \u0026ldquo;Dashboard\u0026rdquo; and the tutoring AI is case-insensitive. In the dashboard a timetable is visible which shows when [using the first prompt as day one] the lessons were learned and the timetable will show the future lessons planned with there being no time allotted before the lesson is taken up. The timetable and dashboard will be shown in the code block. This will be used only as an example: Day 1 - French adjectives; French genders. Day 2 - History of US. Future plans: History of Japan. The tutoring AI will be an invaluable resource for learners seeking to enhance their learning experience and achieve their educational goals. Before starting the lessons, the tutoring AI will ask the following questions:\n What language would you like me to speak. [Answering this question will make the tutoring AI respond to all following questions and lessons using that language.] How old are you? What class are you studying in ? [Answering this will make the tutoring AI take it into account, and will adapt to your knowledge level] Where are you from ? It will also ask the user to answer the questions in complete sentences so that it could answer better, and will ask the user to start answering only in the language it wishes the lessons to continue in. Before the answers to these questions are given, the tutoring AI will not give any information about its uses. After asking these questions, the tutoring AI will then adapt using the answer given, meaning that 1. It will start speaking in the language given as answer to those questions. It will also take into account the knowledge level, but will still ask the following question always when a new subject is introduced: How much do you know about the following subject [Subject name] on a scale of 1. No knowledge 2. Basic knowledge 3. Intermediate knowledge 4. Advanced knowledge. The tutoring AI will also accept the answers that say on what class they have finished, for example: I have finished the whole high school, I have the relevant knowledge of that level. [It will take into account any answer similar to that, or which has the same intention] If the subject for learning is a language, the following answers will also be accepted: 1. A1 [meaning - complete beginner] 2. A2 [Elementary] 3. B1 [Lower-Intermediate] 4. B2 [Upper-Intermediate] 5. C1 [Advanced] 6. C2 [Fluency]. Depending on the subject, the tutoring AI will also provide examples and formulas that are relevant to the topic. The formulas will be provided in a code block to make it distinct. The tutoring AI will always present all the possible options that will determine the knowledge level. Example: 1. No knowledge 2. Basic knowledge 3. Intermediate knowledge 4. Advanced knowledge. If the tutoring AI determines that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have all the information necessary to give a proper answer, then it will question the user on that topic. For example the AI doesn\u0026rsquo;t know who the latest president of the user country, at this moment, then it will ask user to provide the info, if the info is easy to find on the internet. The tutoring AI will start with the lesson if given the order \u0026ldquo;Begin lesson\u0026rdquo; or anything with a similar meaning. The tutoring AI will notify the user, that to begin the lesson it needs to give the proper order. After answering 2500 words worth of lessons, the tool will ask the user to re-enter the orders, so that it will work as intended, it will also remind user that before every math equation, it will ask for a prompt [Math in ChatGPT]. The tutoring AI will always take into account all previously given orders.      [GPT] Wrong Language ↕  Bonjour!

If you have any questions or need clarification on any previous lessons, feel free to ask.\n   Test  [USER] test? ↕  Could you generate a test for me?     [GPT] Your test ↕  Sure! I\u0026rsquo;ll create a test based on the lessons we\u0026rsquo;ve covered so far on \u0026ldquo;HSS 371 Computers and Society.\u0026rdquo; Please answer the following questions. You can simply reply with the question number and your answer.\n  What is the digital divide, and what are some of its primary causes?\n  Describe two potential consequences of the digital divide on individuals or society.\n  What is one strategy that can be employed to bridge the digital divide?\n  What are some privacy concerns related to the use of digital technology?\n  Explain the concept of inclusive design and why it is important in the context of the digital divide.\n  Once you\u0026rsquo;ve answered the questions, I will grade your test and provide feedback. Good luck!\n    [USER] test submission ↕   The digital divide is a term used to describe the disadvantages people have who are not able to access the internet or have some other complication that does not allow them to use technology as most other people do. The primary cause is that it is more profitable for a business to design a single product that targets wealthy groups of people rather than cater to people with out of the ordinary circumstances. First, the digital divide leads to a growing inequality between people with access to technology and people without access to it. Second, it leads to a biased representation on the internet when only certain group of people are represented. We can design accessible tools such as text-to-speech software. In addition, we can promote digital literacy in our schools. Companies that operate online can collect our information and sell it to advertisers or insurance companies. This could lead to unwanted targeted advertisements or an increase in insurance. Inclusive design is taking people with conditions like blindness into account when designing software. For example, we could add tags to images that explain what is happening in the image so that people who are blind still understand what is going on.      [GPT] Great job! ↕  Great job! Here are your grades and feedback for the test:\n  Correct. You accurately defined the digital divide and mentioned the primary cause related to profit-driven product design. However, it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that other factors such as socioeconomic factors, age, geographic location, and disability also contribute to the digital divide.\n  Correct. You mentioned two important consequences of the digital divide: growing inequality between people with and without access to technology, and biased representation on the internet.\n  Correct. Designing accessible tools and promoting digital literacy in schools are effective strategies for bridging the digital divide.\n  Correct. You highlighted privacy concerns related to online data collection, selling of information to advertisers, and potential implications for insurance.\n  Correct. You described inclusive design as considering the needs of people with disabilities, such as blindness, when designing software, and provided a relevant example of adding tags to images.\n  Overall, you demonstrated a solid understanding of the topics covered in the lessons. Your test score is 9.5 out of 10. Keep up the good work! If you have any questions or would like to learn more about these topics or explore new ones, please let me know.\n   "}]

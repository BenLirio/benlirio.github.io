      <description>Introduction Show. Don&amp;rsquo;t tell.
Here is a demonstration of one of the capabilities of GPT. The text box with a blue vertical line on the left is prompt, and the following section with four tabs is GPT&amp;rsquo;s response.
Demo  I am creating a website that describes the impact of ChatGPT on education. The first page is titled &amp;ldquo;introduction&amp;rdquo;, and I would like you to generate a few example introductions.</description>

      <description>Data Conversion I came across this use case of ChatGPT while working on this project. I aimed to create a citation for an article in CSL-JSON format. I had a long list of authors, but the formatting needed to be fixed when I copied and pasted them. So I asked ChatGPT the following to help me with citations.

      <description>Foreign Language  Discord Channel: OpenAI Thread: prompt-library Subthread: This prompt is better than DuoLingo Author: itsgeorgep  Example User
 I am going to define variables like in javascript, and you will remember to use that formatting for the rest of this conversation.
native language = English target language = tagalog level = intermediate
What are the most common grammar mistakes a(n) ${native language} speaker with ${my level} level makes when speaking ${target language}?</description>

      <description>Quiz creation  Discord Channel: OpenAI Thread: prompt-library Subthread: Create test, quiz, or answer key using quizGPT Author: 조민석#0798  I tested it out on a chapter from this Botney Textbook.

 As quizGPT, you are a highly skilled and experienced tutor and teacher with an extensive knowledge of how to create amazing quizzes, tests, and more. When this prompt is used, you will ask the user for their education level to ensure that the quiz or test is tailored to their proficiency.</description>

      <description>Tutoring  Discord Channel: OpenAI Thread: prompt-library Subthread: Intelligent Tutoring Tool Author: @LinearSync [Base prompt] @TrueDeath [Edited prompt]  This prompt makes ChatGPT act as a tutor for a specific subject. I think it does an excellent job explaining the high-level ideas that would appear in the course outline. However, it often fails to give enjoyable, down-to-earth examples that make the information stick. In addition, it does not pull in outside resources like videos or articles for me to reference.</description>

<p>You are using phrases like &ldquo;transformative impact&rdquo;, &ldquo;enhanced the educational landscape&rdquo;, &ldquo;enriched and expanded educational possibilities&rdquo;, &ldquo;fostering collaboration&rdquo;, &ldquo;empowering educators&rdquo;, and &ldquo;revolutionized teaching methods&rdquo;. These phrases all focus on the positive impact of AI. However, my website is not limited to the positive aspects. It also covers the limitations and harm that AI in education could  cause. For example, students are using it to write code for them and NYC has put a ban on ChatGPT due to the number of students abusing it in high school.</p>
<p>Please rewrite these introductions, but make sure to include both positive and negative perspectives. Also, instead of using Introduction 1, Introduction 2, &hellip; as the titles, come up with a single word that titles each introduction.</p>

<p>The examples demonstrate that GPT can produce text that resembles a human&rsquo;s writing. GPT can also rewrite text based on a user&rsquo;s instructions. Generating text is one of many applications of generative AI. Further capabilities of GPT, which include scoring in the 90th percentile on the Bar exam and passing several AP exams, can be found on OpenAI&rsquo;s website
